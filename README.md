# 🧪📘 AI Tutor Agents – Physics & Chemistry with Agno + Gemini
Welcome to AI Tutor Agents, an interactive educational platform that brings subject-specific AI tutors to life using Agno, Gemini AI, and Streamlit. This project features smart Physics and Chemistry agents that guide users through academic questions in a conversational, intuitive way.

🚀 Features
🧠 Multi-Agent Tutor System (Powered by Agno)
Physics Agent – Get help with Newtonian mechanics, optics, motion, thermodynamics, and more.

Chemistry Agent – Ask questions on atomic structure, chemical bonding, equations, and periodic trends.

💬 Interactive Chat Interface
Ask questions naturally, like you would with a teacher.

Receive accurate, subject-specific, step-by-step responses.

⚡ Powered by Agno + Gemini
Uses Agno’s multi-agent framework to orchestrate subject-specific reasoning.

Powered by Google Gemini API for fast, intelligent, and safe LLM responses.

🌐 Built with Streamlit
Clean, simple, browser-based UI.

Fast switching between Physics and Chemistry agents.
